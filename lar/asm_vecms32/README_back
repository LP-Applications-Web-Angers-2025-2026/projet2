1. DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	This project aims at comparing two implementations of the 
	merge sort algorithm. The first one is the basic implementation
	and the second one uses a reordering of four contiguous 
	(adjacent) values in a SSE register.
	
	By doing this we face three difficulties:
	
	1 the first one is that the reordering SSE instruction PSHUFD
	  accepts only one constant as the reordering operand, so we
	  need to modify this parameter of the assembly instruction
	  on the fly
	  
	2 the second one concerns the modification of the instruction
	  operand which is not possible by default in the .text 
	  section so we need to put the instruction either in the .data 
	  section or enable the .text section to be modified by using 
	  mprotect
	  
	3 in order to determine which reodering must be used we compute
	  a value which acts as an identifier, but it can only be
	  computed efficiently using the PEXT assembly instruction that
	  is part of the BMI (Bit Manipulation) instructions Sets.
	  There are two sets published by Intel: BMI1 and BMI2, they 
	  were both introduced with the Haswell microarchitecture (2013).
	  So some computers do not have this instruction and therefore
	  it is necessary to implement it with a series of and/or/shr
	  instructions

2. INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.a Prerequiste

	You first need to install nasm (The Netwide Assembler) and
	g++.

2.b Compilation

	From the command line, just type 
	
		> make clean && make
		
	All objects files and the binary will be sent to the 'build' directory 
	that will be created in the directory of the project.
	


---------------------------------------------------------------------	
3. PERFORMANCE TESTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	Run the ./test_performance.sh script from the directory of 
	the project. It will execute the program on different sizes
	of array

	All results will be put in the 'results.txt' file
	
	You can check the 'results.txt' file with some results
	obtained on different architectures
